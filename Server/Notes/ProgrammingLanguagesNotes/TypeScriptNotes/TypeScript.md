# TypeScript Basics

## Overview
---

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It enables developers to catch errors at compile time, improve code maintainability, and build scalable applications.

---

## Key Features
---

- **Static Typing:** Allows developers to define variable types explicitly, reducing runtime errors.
- **Type Inference:** Automatically infers types when not explicitly declared, providing flexibility.
- **Advanced Tooling:** Improves the developer experience with features like IntelliSense and autocompletion.
- **Compatibility:** Fully interoperable with JavaScript, making it easy to adopt in existing projects.
- **Scalability:** Simplifies working with large codebases by enforcing consistent type definitions.

---

## Benefits of Using TypeScript
---

- **Error Detection:** Identifies potential issues during development instead of at runtime.
- **Code Readability:** Enhances the clarity and self-documenting nature of code.
- **Better Collaboration:** Ensures consistency and reduces misunderstandings in team environments.
- **Future-Proofing:** Aligns well with modern JavaScript standards and features.

## Managing Import Paths in TypeScript
---

In TypeScript projects, managing imports is crucial for maintaining clean and readable code. There are two main ways to manage import paths:

- **Relative Paths:** Use <span class="emphasis">./</span>, <span class="emphasis">../</span>, and <span class="emphasis">../../</span> to navigate between directories.
  - Suitable for small projects but can become cumbersome in larger ones.
- **Path Aliases:** Configure aliases in the <span class="emphasis">tsconfig.json</span> file to replace lengthy relative paths with concise shorthand paths like <span class="emphasis">@/</span>.
  - Example: Instead of <span class="emphasis">../../components/Button</span>, use <span class="emphasis">@/components/Button</span>.

### Benefits of Path Aliases
- **Readability:** Makes imports shorter and more understandable.
- **Refactoring:** Simplifies file movements without breaking imports.
- **Scalability:** Ideal for large projects with deep directory structures.

### Configuring Path Aliases in tsconfig.json
To define path aliases:
1. Set the <span class="emphasis">baseUrl</span> to the root directory.
2. Define paths in the <span class="emphasis">paths</span> option to map aliases to specific directories.
