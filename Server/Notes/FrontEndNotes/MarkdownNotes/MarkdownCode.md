## Code Snippets

---

When rendering code snippets in Markdown, enclose them in triple backticks <span className="emphasis">```</span>. Optionally, specify the language for syntax highlighting.

## Embedding Images in Markdown

---

You can embed an image in a Markdown file so that it displays directly instead of showing as a link. To do this, add an exclamation mark <span className="emphasis">!</span> before the square brackets and parentheses.

- This ensures the image is embedded and visible directly in the rendered file.

### Syntax

---

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

- **Alt text**: Describes the image for accessibility or in case it fails to load.
- **Path to image**: The relative or absolute URL of the image.

### Example

```markdown
![Placeholder](https://placehold.co/200x100/png)
```

This will render:

![Placeholder](https://placehold.co/200x100/png)

However, the following code and example will render a **clickable link** that redirects to the image when clicked:

```markdown
[Placeholder](https://placehold.co/200x100/png)
```

[Placeholder](https://placehold.co/200x100/png)

## Embedding URLs in Markdown

---

To create a clickable hyperlink in Markdown, omit the exclamation mark <span className="emphasis">!</span>. This renders the text inside the square brackets <span className="emphasis">[ ]</span> as clickable, linking to the URL provided in the parentheses <span className="emphasis">( )</span>.

### Syntax

---

```markdown
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

- **Link Text**: The text displayed as the link.
- **URL**: The destination of the hyperlink.

### Example

```markdown
[Google](https://www.google.com/)
```

This will render:

[Google](https://www.google.com/)

## Best Practices for Images and URLs

1. **Start with Definitions**: Explain URLs and images separately to clarify their syntax.
2. **Provide Examples**: Use clear, functional examples for both links and images.
3. **Highlight Differences**: Use a comparison table or examples to emphasize the distinction between links and images.
4. **Include Code Snippets**: Demonstrate usage directly in Markdown files for better understanding.
