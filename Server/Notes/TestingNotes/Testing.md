# Basic Testing Concepts

<span class="emphasis">CircleCI</span> is a <span class="emphasis">continuous integration</span> and <span class="emphasis">continuous deployment</span> tool that helps <span class="emphasis">integrate</span> code into a <span class="emphasis">repository</span> and <span class="emphasis">build</span> tests.

# Unit Testing Frameworks

Unit testing frameworks help developers test individual pieces of code (like functions or classes) in isolation. Popular frameworks include:

- <span class="emphasis">Vitest</span> (integration with Vite)
- Jest (flexible and powerful for JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Mocha (customizable with plugins)
- Jasmine (behavior-driven development)

# Integration Testing Concepts

Integration testing ensures that various components of an application work together as expected. While not detailed here, it's important to consider how tools like Jest or Cypress can be configured for such use cases.

# End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E testing or (end-to-end testing) tests the entire application from start to finish from the end user's perspective.

- Ensure the entire application is running for effective testing.

For tools like Cypress, refer to the <span class="emphasis">CypressTesting.md</span> file for detailed information.
