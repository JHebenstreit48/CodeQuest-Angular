## GraphQL Basics
---

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

---

## Key Concepts of GraphQL
---

### Queries  
- Used to request specific data from the server.  

### Mutations  
- Used to modify data on the server (create, update, or delete).  

### Resolvers  
- Functions that handle how data is fetched for queries and mutations.  

#### 4 Positional Parameters in Resolvers  
The positional parameters passed to a resolver function are:  
   - `parent`  
   - `args`  
   - `context`  
   - `info`
